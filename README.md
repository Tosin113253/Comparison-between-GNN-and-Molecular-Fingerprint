# GNN for Degradation Rate Constant Prediction

This project employs Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), including Graph Attention Networks (GAT) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), and their combination, to predict the photodegradation rate constant (log k) of water contaminants on the TiO₂ photocatalyst. The models are trained on combined experimental and molecular graph features. And compare the result with the molecular fingerprint.
